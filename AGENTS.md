# Repository Guidelines

This repository stores a collection of static web sites for different
AI-related domains. Follow these rules when contributing:

- **Separate folders**:Each AI domain must reside in its own dedicated top-level folder within the repository.
- **Static only**: Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Avoid using frameworks or build systems unless absolutely necessary.
- **Images**: Place all image assets in an `images/` subfolder within the respective domain folder. Use placeholder images where actual images are needed.
- **Readmes**: Do not create a `README.md` file inside new domain folders
- **Testing**: there are no automated tests. Verify pages load correctly in a
  browser before committing.
- **Unique Content**: Update the content of all `.html` and `.css` files to reflect the specific domain.
  Ensure each page's content is substantially different from that of existing domain folders (titles, text, purpose).
- **Custom Color Palette**: Apply a unique color palette for each domain.
  Implement both light and dark modes with appropriate contrast and appearance.
- **Distinct Layout & Structure**: Design a layout that is visually and structurally different from other folders.
  Examples include different navigation styles, grid layouts, font choices, and section arrangements.
- **Images**: Where image content is required, insert placeholder images as a temporary stand-in.
  
Pull requests should include a short summary of the changes and any manual
steps taken to verify the pages render as expected.
