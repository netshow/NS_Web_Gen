# Repository Guidelines

This repository stores a collection of static web sites for different
AI-related domains. Follow these rules when contributing:

- **Separate folders**:Each AI domain must reside in its own dedicated top-level folder within the repository.
- **Static only**: Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Avoid using frameworks or build systems unless absolutely necessary.
- **Readmes**: Do not create a `README.md` file inside new domain folders
- **Testing**: there are no automated tests. Verify pages load correctly in a
  browser before committing.
- **Content & Design**: Reference Website Replication:
  Each domain website should closely replicate a chosen reference website, with:
    - Updated content based on the specific business idea.
    - A slightly modified layout or structure to differentiate it from the original reference.
    - Maintain a similar tone and structure, but do not directly copy assets or text.
  Unique Domain Identity:
    - Ensure content in all `.html` and `.css` files reflects the specific AI domain/business idea.
    - Content must be substantially different from that of other domain folders (e.g., titles, descriptions, calls-to-action).
- **Design Rules**: 
  - Custom Color Palette:
    Each domain must have a unique color palette, supporting both light and dark modes with proper contrast and legibility.
  - Distinct Layout:
    - Design a layout that is visually and structurally different from other domain folders.
    - Examples include different:
      - Navigation styles
      - Font pairings
      - Grid systems
      - Section arrangements
    - Placeholder Images:
      Insert placeholder images where images are needed. These can later be replaced with actual images relevant to the domain.
