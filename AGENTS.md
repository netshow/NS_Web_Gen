# Repository Guidelines  

This repository stores a collection of static web sites for different AI-related domains. Follow these rules when contributing:  

## Structure & Files  
- **Separate folders**: Each AI domain must reside in its own dedicated top-level folder within the repository.  
- **Static only**: Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Avoid using frameworks or build systems unless absolutely necessary.  
- **Readmes**: Do not create a README.md file inside new domain folders.  
- **Testing**: There are no automated tests. Verify pages load correctly in a browser before committing.  

## Content & Design  
- **Reference Website Replication**: Each domain website should closely replicate a chosen reference website, with:  
  - Updated content based on the specific business idea.  
  - A slightly modified layout or structure to differentiate it from the original reference.  
  - Maintain a similar tone and structure, but do not directly copy assets or text.  

- **Unique Domain Identity**:  
  - Ensure content in all `.html` and `.css` files reflects the specific AI domain/business idea.  
  - Content must be substantially different from that of other domain folders (e.g., titles, descriptions, calls-to-action).  
  - Each Title, Description, Text, and Icon must be updated according to the Domain and Business Idea.  
  - Make sure content (Title, Text, Description, and Icons) is not the same as `agentide-website`.  
  - Each page should have unique and different titles, descriptions, and icons according to the Business Idea and Domain provided.  

## Design Rules  
- **Custom Color Palette**: Each domain must have a unique color palette, supporting both **light and dark modes** with proper contrast and legibility.  
- **Modern & Professional Look**: Websites should use a more modern and professional-looking design across all pages and elements.  
- **Distinct Layout**:  
  - Design a layout that is visually and structurally different from other domain folders.  
  - Examples include different:  
    - Navigation styles  
    - Font pairings  
    - Grid systems  
    - Section arrangements  
- **Light & Dark Mode Support**: Every element, text, background, and component must adapt properly in both light and dark themes.  
- **Placeholder Images**: Insert placeholder images where images are needed. These can later be replaced with actual images relevant to the domain.  

## Pull Requests Should Include:  
- Summary of changes.  
- Mention of reference website used (if applicable).  
- Manual verification steps (e.g., "Tested in Chrome/Firefox and mobile view").  
- Confirmation that all guidelines above have been followed.
