                        <p class="text-center text-sm-start">Welcome to Agent IDE Org! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Agent IDE Org website and services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using Agent IDE Org, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>
                        <p class="text-center text-sm-start">For your convenience, we’ve written these Terms in plain language, but they still form a legally binding contract. Please read them carefully.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
                        <p>By creating an account or using Agent IDE Org in any manner, you confirm that you are at least 16 years old (or the legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding contract) and that you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are using Agent IDE Org on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing on behalf of that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind them to these Terms.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. Description of Service</h3>
                        <p>Agent IDE Org is a web-based platform that enables users to create, configure, and deploy AI agents without coding. We provide tools including a web interface for building agents, integration with AI models and third-party services, and hosting for running those agents. We continuously improve the Service, so specific features and offerings may evolve over time. Any new features that we add which enhance or modify the current Service (including the release of new tools or resources) will also be subject to these Terms.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. User Accounts</h3>
                        <p><strong>Registration:</strong> You need an account to use Agent IDE Org. When registering, you agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the signup form, and to maintain and promptly update such information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials, and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
                        <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> Please use a strong, unique password and safeguard it. If you suspect any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:security@agentide.org">security@agentide.org</a>. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
                        <p><strong>Account Restrictions:</strong> You may not use another user’s account without permission. We reserve the right to refuse registration or cancel an account at our discretion (for example, if we detect misuse or violation of these Terms).</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. Proper Use of the Service</h3>
                        <p>We want Agent IDE Org to be useful and safe for everyone. By using the Service, you agree to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lawful Purposes:</strong> Use Agent IDE Org only for lawful purposes. You will not use the Service to create agents or content that is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. This includes (but isn’t limited to) not using agents for spamming, phishing, creating malware, harassment, hate speech, or violating any person’s rights.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> Comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations in your use of Agent IDE Org. If your agents perform actions (like sending messages or scraping data), ensure those actions are legal and adhere to third-party terms (for example, if an agent accesses a website, it should respect that website’s terms of service or robots.txt).</li>
                            <li><strong>No Unauthorized Access:</strong> Not attempt to interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers (e.g., by distributing malware, conducting denial-of-service attacks, or accessing APIs in a way not provided by us). You also agree not to reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of our platform, unless laws allow those actions.</li>
                            <li><strong>User Content:</strong> You are responsible for the content and configurations you input into Agent IDE Org (“User Content”). Ensure you have the rights to use any data or content you include. For example, if you upload a dataset or use an API key, you must have the right to use that data/key. Do not upload or use content that infringes on others’ intellectual property or privacy rights.</li>
                            <li><strong>AI Outputs:</strong> Understand that AI-generated outputs from agents are generated by algorithms and may not always be accurate or appropriate. You will use discretion and judgment before acting on or deploying any AI output, especially in critical contexts. (In other words, keep an eye on your agents – don’t blindly trust them with highly sensitive or impactful tasks without supervision).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
                        <p><strong>Our IP:</strong> Agent IDE Org and all content and materials provided by us (excluding your User Content) are owned by Agent IDE Org or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. This includes the software, design, logos, trademarks, graphics, and any templates or documentation we provide. We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our Service and materials solely for your personal or internal business use in accordance with these Terms. You may not reuse, distribute, or create derivative works from our content unless we explicitly allow it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Your IP:</strong> You retain all rights to your User Content and to the outputs your agents generate (subject to any underlying model or third-party tool licenses). We do not claim ownership of the content or data you provide to Agent IDE Org. However, by using the Service, you grant us the rights necessary to operate it – for example, the right to store, transmit, and display your content within the platform as needed to provide the service to you (this is a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license for that limited purpose). We will never use your User Content for marketing or external purposes without your consent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Third-Party IP:</strong> If you use third-party integrations or content (like connecting an API or incorporating someone else’s content in your agent’s logic), be mindful of those third-party intellectual property rights and terms. Agent IDE Org isn’t responsible for what you integrate; that responsibility lies with you.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. Pricing and Payments</h3>
                        <p><strong>Free and Paid Plans:</strong> Agent IDE Org may offer a free tier as well as paid subscription plans with additional features or higher usage limits. Details of current plans and pricing are provided on our website. By selecting a paid plan, you agree to pay the subscription fees and any applicable taxes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Billing:</strong> Paid subscriptions will be billed in advance on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually, depending on your plan). You must provide a valid payment method (e.g., credit card) and ensure it remains up-to-date. If we cannot charge your payment method (due to expiration, insufficient funds, etc.), we will attempt to notify you. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel your access to paid features if payment is not made.</p>
                        <p><strong>Changes to Fees:</strong> We may change the fees for our Service (or introduce new charges) with prior notice to you. Any changes will apply at the start of your next billing cycle. If you do not agree with a fee change, you may cancel your subscription before the new fee takes effect.</p>
                        <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> If you cancel a paid subscription, you will retain access to paid features until the end of the period you’ve paid for. We typically do not offer refunds for partial periods. However, if you believe you deserve a refund due to an issue or mistake, please contact our support and we’ll review on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">7. Cancellation and Termination</h3>
                        <p><strong>By You:</strong> You can cancel your Agent IDE Org account or subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting support. Canceling a subscription will stop future billing, but you’ll keep access until the current paid period ends. Deleting your account will permanently remove your access and your data (as described in the Privacy Policy).</p>
                        <p><strong>By Us:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or engage in activity that harms the service or other users. We will attempt to notify you of the reason and allow you to correct the issue (if fixable) before termination, but we are not required to provide notice in severe cases (e.g., malicious attacks, illegal activity). We also may terminate the Service (we hope not!) or your account for convenience with reasonable notice (e.g., if we discontinue the platform, with at least 30 days notice).</p>
                        <p><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Service ceases. We may delete your User Content after termination, and you will no longer have access to it (so back up any data you need before ending your account). Any provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (like intellectual property rights, warranty disclaimers, and liability limits) will remain in effect.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
                        <p><strong>Service “As Is”:</strong> Agent IDE Org is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. While we strive for excellence and uptime, we cannot guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or meet your specific needs. Use it at your own risk.</p>
                        <p><strong>No Implicit Warranties:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, Agent IDE Org and its affiliates, suppliers, and partners disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranty that may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade. We make no guarantee that our AI agents’ outputs are correct or reliable. (They’re often very useful, but they are AI – and AI can sometimes be unpredictable or require human oversight.)</p>
                        <p><strong>Not Professional Advice:</strong> Any information or output from the Service (for example, content an agent writes or decisions it suggests) is not intended as professional advice (legal, financial, etc.). Always exercise independent judgment and, if needed, seek professional advice before relying on AI-generated results for important decisions.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
                        <p><strong>Exclusion of Certain Damages:</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Agent IDE Org (and its parent, officers, employees, and partners) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages. This includes any loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or costs of substitute services, arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use the Service. This is true even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cap on Liability:</strong> To the fullest extent permitted by law, Agent IDE Org’s total cumulative liability for any claims arising out of or related to the Service or these Terms, regardless of the form of the action, will not exceed the greater of: (a) the total amount you have paid us for use of the Service in the 6 months prior to the claim, or (b) $100 USD.</p>
                        <p><strong>Jurisdictional Limitations:</strong> Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability, so some of the above may not apply to you. In such cases, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
                        <p><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for any interactions or decisions made based on your use of Agent IDE Org. This platform is a tool, and how you use the tool (and any consequences thereof) is under your discretion. You agree that we are not liable for any outcomes from the agents you create – e.g., if your agent sends an unintended email or misclassification occurs, you bear that risk.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">10. Indemnification</h3>
                        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Agent IDE Org, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or in any way connected with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your access to or use of the Service (including any actions taken by your agents).</li>
                            <li>Your violation of these Terms.</li>
                            <li>Your infringement of any intellectual property or other rights of any third party, or your violation of any law in connection with your use of Agent IDE Org.</li>
                            <li>Any content or data you provide to the Service (e.g., if someone claims that content you uploaded infringes their rights).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We reserve the right to handle our legal defense as we see fit, including choosing our counsel, and you agree to cooperate with us in executing that defense.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">11. Modifications to the Service or Terms</h3>
                        <p><strong>Service Changes:</strong> We are constantly improving Agent IDE Org. We may add, remove, or modify features or services (and in some cases we may cease an offering entirely). We’ll endeavor to notify you of major changes, especially if they affect how you use the service or your data. For example, if we sunset a particular integration, we might notify affected users ahead of time. However, some minor tweaks or emergency changes might happen with little notice.</p>
                        <p><strong>Terms Changes:</strong> We may revise these Terms from time to time. If we make a significant change, we will notify you (for instance, via email or a prominent notice on our site). Updated Terms will be posted on our website with a new “Last Updated” date. By continuing to use the Service after changes become effective, you agree to the new Terms. If you don’t agree, you must stop using Agent IDE Org and (if applicable) cancel your account.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
                        <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles, unless mandated differently by laws of your jurisdiction (for example, if you reside in a country with certain consumer protection laws).</p>
                        <p><strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> We genuinely hope to never have disputes with our users, but if issues arise, let’s try to resolve them amicably:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contact Us First:</strong> If you have any dispute or issue, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@agentide.org">support@agentide.org</a> or <a href="mailto:legal@agentide.org">legal@agentide.org</a>. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally through dialogue within 30 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arbitration (if applicable):</strong> If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree that any unresolved controversy or claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) shall be settled by binding arbitration conducted confidentially. The arbitration will be conducted in English, and administered by a recognized arbitration association (e.g., AAA) under its rules. The location of arbitration will be California, unless you and Agent IDE Org agree otherwise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opt-out and small claims:</strong> You have the right to opt out of arbitration within 30 days of first agreeing to these Terms (if so, send an email to <a href="mailto:legal@agentide.org">legal@agentide.org</a> stating your opt-out). Also, either party can choose to bring a qualifying claim in small claims court rather than arbitration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action. This means no class actions or group arbitrations.</li>
