                        <p class="text-center text-sm-start">At agentIdeidea.com, we prioritize your privacy and the security of your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect from you, how we use it, and the choices you have regarding your data. We are committed to transparency and compliance with all relevant data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
                        <p class="text-center text-sm-start">By using agentIdeidea.com (the “Service”), you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. Information We Collect</h3>
                        <p>We only collect data that is necessary to provide and improve our services to you. This includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign up, we collect basic information like your name, email address, and organization (if provided). This is used to create your user account and identify you on subsequent logins.</li>
                            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We gather data on how you interact with agentIdeidea.com – for example, the features you use, the types of agents you build (not the content of your agents), and time spent on the platform. This data is usually collected in aggregate and helps us understand usage patterns to make the product better.</li>
                            <li><strong>Agent Data:</strong> When you create agents or provide content (like prompts, configurations, or data sources for your agents), that information is stored on our servers so that your agent can function. This may include textual instructions you give the agent or data you connect (e.g., a database or API keys you plug in).</li>
                            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us for support or feedback, we may keep records of that correspondence (including your contact info and the content of your messages).</li>
                            <li><strong>Device and Technical Data:</strong> Like most web platforms, we automatically collect technical information when you use agentIdeidea.com, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers. We also use cookies or similar technologies to remember your preferences and enhance user experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> We do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal information (such as personal health data, political opinions, etc.) through agentIdeidea.com. We ask that you refrain from inputting such data into the platform. If you must, ensure you have the legal right to do so and understand the risks.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                        <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> We process your data to deliver the features of agentIdeidea.com. For example, storing your agent configurations, enabling you to log in, and running your agents.</li>
                            <li><strong>To Improve agentIdeidea.com:</strong> Usage data and feedback help us debug issues, optimize performance, and develop new features that better serve you. We may analyze usage trends (anonymously or in aggregate) to inform our product decisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>To Communicate with You:</strong> We use your email or contact info to send important updates about your account or the service (for example, password resets, security alerts, or significant feature changes). We may also send newsletters or product announcements, but you can opt out of non-essential communications at any time.</li>
                            <li><strong>For Customer Support:</strong> Information you provide in support requests is used to help resolve your issue and improve our support processes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal and Security Reasons:</strong> We may process your data to comply with legal obligations, enforce our Terms of Use, or protect the rights, property, or safety of our users and company. For instance, monitoring for fraudulent or abusive activity.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>AI Model Training:</strong> A crucial point – we do NOT use your personal data or the content of your agents to train our AI models or any third-party AI, unless you explicitly opt-in to such a program. Your data remains your data. As our partner AgentIdea.ai puts it, “we are not using your data for training…and it’s just private (unless you decide to share)”. We firmly stand by this principle.</p>


                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                        <p>agentIdeidea.com respects your privacy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We only share data in the following contexts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use reputable third-party services to help operate agentIdeidea.com (for example, cloud hosting on Google Firebase or AgentIdea.ai’s infrastructure, email communication tools, analytics services). These providers process data on our behalf and are contractually obligated to safeguard your information and only use it for the services we request.</li>

                            <li><strong>Integrated Services and APIs:</strong> If you connect your agent to external services (like a Google account, Slack, etc.), you will be asked to grant permission via those services’ OAuth or API. In such cases, data will be exchanged between agentIdeidea.com and that external service only as needed for the integration (for example, your agent reading a Google Sheet if you connected Google Sheets). We never access more data from third-party services than necessary, and we do so under the permissions you grant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required by law or valid legal process (subpoena, court order, etc.), we may disclose certain data to authorities. We will do our best to inform you if such requests occur, unless legally prohibited.</li>
                            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data might be part of the transfer. If that happens, we will ensure the new entity honors the commitments made in this Privacy Policy, and we will notify you of any changes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Contributions:</strong> If our platform offers community forums or sharing of agent templates (current or future), any information you voluntarily share in public areas is, of course, visible to others. Use caution when posting personal or sensitive info in those contexts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
                        <p>agentIdeidea.com uses cookies and similar technologies (like web beacons or local storage) to provide and improve the user experience. For example, cookies help keep you logged in as you navigate, remember your preferences (such as language), and understand how you use our site.</p>
                        <p>You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings. However, be aware that disabling cookies might affect certain functionalities of our service (for instance, you might be logged out more frequently or some features may not remember your settings).</p>
                        <p>We do not use cookies for third-party advertising on our site. Any tracking is primarily for internal analytics and improving the platform.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">5. Data Security</h3>
                        <p>We take security seriously. agentIdeidea.com employs industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All communications with agentIdeidea.com (the website and IDE) are encrypted via HTTPS.</li>
                            <li>Passwords are stored securely (hashed and salted). We never store your password in plain text.</li>
                            <li>Our databases and servers are protected by firewalls and regular security audits. We utilize secure cloud infrastructure (such as Google Firebase and AgentIdea.ai’s secure servers) known for their robust protection.</li>

                            <li>Access to personal data within our organization is restricted to authorized personnel who need it to operate or improve the service. They are bound by confidentiality.</li>
                            <li>We regularly back up data and have disaster recovery plans, while also ensuring backups have equal security.</li>
                            <li>We test our platform for vulnerabilities and keep our software up-to-date to guard against exploits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, no system can be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We encourage you to use a strong unique password for agentIdeidea.com and to notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. Data Retention</h3>
                        <p>We retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you delete your account (or request deletion), we will delete or anonymize your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, except for data we are required to keep for legal reasons (e.g., transaction records for accounting, logs for security).</p>
                        <p>Agent data (the agents you create and associated content) will be deleted when you delete your account or specifically remove those agents. We might retain non-personal aggregated data (for example, number of agents created for statistical purposes) as this does not identify you.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">7. Your Rights and Choices</h3>
                        <p><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You can access and update most of your account information by logging into agentIdeidea.com and visiting your account settings. For any additional data that isn’t readily accessible, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@agentIdeidea.com">privacy@agentIdeidea.com</a> and we will provide you with information we have about you or correct inaccuracies, as required by applicable law.</p>

                        <p><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of your data in a machine-readable format. For example, you can export your agent configurations from the platform at any time. For other data, contact support.</p>
                        <p><strong>Deletion (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You may request deletion of your personal data. Keep in mind, deletion might mean we have to close your account and remove your agents. To request deletion, you can use the account deletion option in settings or email us. We will process such requests in accordance with GDPR/CCPA and other laws, meaning we’ll remove data unless we have legitimate grounds to keep it (if so, we’ll let you know).</p>
                        <p><strong>Opt-Out of Communications:</strong> If you no longer want to receive our newsletter or promotional emails, you can opt out via the unsubscribe link in those emails or in your account email preferences. Note that we will still send essential emails (like password resets or important notices) even if you opt out of marketing messages.</p>
                        <p><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Our site currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” signals from browsers because there is no standard for these signals. However, we limit our tracking to first-party usage analytics and do not track you across third-party sites.</p>
                        <p><strong>California Residents (CCPA):</strong> If you are a California resident, you have the right to request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information we have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes (we do not currently share data for direct marketing beyond our own service). CCPA also gives rights to access or delete personal info, which we cover above. You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under CCPA on your behalf by providing that agent written permission.</p>
                        <p><strong>European Union (GDPR):</strong> If you are in the EU, you have the right to object to or restrict certain processing of your data, and to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe our processing violates the law. Our legal basis for processing your data is typically your consent (when you sign up and agree to this policy) and the necessity to fulfill our contract with you (providing the service). We may also process data for legitimate interests (improving our product, preventing fraud), but not at the expense of your rights and freedoms.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">8. Children’s Privacy</h3>
                        <p>agentIdeidea.com is not directed to individuals under 16 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If you are under 16, please do not use our service or provide any information. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such data. If you are a parent or guardian and suspect your child has used our site, please contact us so we can ensure their information is removed.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">9. International Data Transfers</h3>
                        <p>agentIdeidea.com is operated from the United States. If you are accessing our service from outside the US, be aware that your information will be transferred to and processed in the US (or other regions where our servers or service providers are located). We rely on standard contractual clauses or other safeguards for any transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA or other regions with data transfer restrictions, to ensure your data is protected. By using the service, you consent to transferring your data to the US and globally for the purposes described in this policy.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">10. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal,or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes, we will notify you via email or a prominent notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective. The “Effective Date” at the top will always indicate when the policy was last revised.</p>
                        <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">11. Contact Us</h3>
